# Curriculum formatting audit (issue #14)

Step 1 of the Open Vector improvement plan — a per-lesson punch list of formatting deviations from canon. Tick each box as its file is fixed.

## Workflow

Fixes are packaged **by level** — one branch and one PR per level, one commit per file inside the branch. This bundles the related changes for issue #14 while preserving per-file commit history. (Default curriculum workflow remains one-file-per-branch; level-packaging is the exception for coordinated multi-file cleanups.)

- Branch name pattern: `fix-curriculum-fmt-{level-slug}-02may` (e.g. `fix-curriculum-fmt-00-orientation-02may`).
- Open the PR when every file in that level is committed and its checkbox below is ticked.
- **Six PRs total: levels 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05.**

## Canon

1. **Frontmatter — required keys (any order):** `slug`, `title`, `subtitle`, `duration`, `status`. Optional, not a deviation if absent: `badge`, `updatedAt`, `knowledgeCheck`. ✅ All 40 files conform.
2. **Code fences — language hints** when content is identifiably one of `bash`, `javascript`/`js`, `jsx`, `css`, `json`, `yaml`, `markdown`. **Bare fences are correct** for ASCII diagrams, file-tree drawings, terminal prompt examples that aren't commands, freeform output, prompt/dialogue text, and pseudocode outlines.
3. **`:::resources` directive title:** canon is `"Go Deeper"`. `"Links"` is a deviation.
4. **Heading hierarchy:** body uses `##` for sections, `###` for subsections. No body H1; the title comes from frontmatter. ✅ All 40 files conform.
5. **List bullets:** unordered lists use `-` (hyphen). ✅ All 40 files conform.
6. **Spacing:** single blank line between sections, no triple blank lines. ✅ All 40 files conform.
7. **Bulletized exercises:** `:::exercise{title="..."}` content is a bulleted action list (lines starting with `-`), not paragraph prose. Levels 00 and 01 already conform; levels 02–05 are mostly prose and need conversion.
8. **Inline code in prose:** wrap in single backticks for literal commands (`npm run build`, `git push`), CLI flags (`--version`), file/folder names (`.env`, `dist/`, `CLAUDE.md`), file paths (`/Users/...`, `~/projects`), code identifiers (`useState`, `BookList`), API endpoints/payloads, and environment variable names (`BUTTONDOWN_API_KEY`). **Do not** backtick general concepts ("the database"), product names in prose (React, Git, Vite, Netlify), or capitalized concept names. Apply this rule both in main prose **and** inside the new exercise bullets.

## Cross-cutting

- **Code fences:** every code block in the curriculum (45 blocks across 20 lessons) uses bare ` ``` `. The fixes per lesson below add language hints only where content is identifiably a language; diagrams, prompts, and pseudocode stay bare.
- **`:::resources{title="Links"}`:** 3 lessons deviate from "Go Deeper" canon. Listed inline below.
- **Bulletized exercises:** 25 of the 26 exercises in levels 02–05 are paragraph prose. The lone exception is `02-the-medium/claude-code.md`. Levels 00 and 01 are already done. The fix per lesson is the same shape: convert the prose paragraph(s) inside `:::exercise` into a bulleted action list, matching the canon set in `01-foundation/architecture.md`.
- **Inline code in prose:** levels 00–01 already done. In 02–05, most files are clean but a handful have specific gaps in main prose; flagged inline below. When bulletizing exercises, also apply inline-code formatting to literal commands, paths, and identifiers within the new bullets — these are not flagged exhaustively below since they fall out naturally from the bulletization pass.
